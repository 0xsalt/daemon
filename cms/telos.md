# TELOS Framework

TELOS is my personal framework for tracking purpose and direction. It's a structured approach to understanding problems, defining missions, and building toward something that matters.

## The Core Thesis

**I believe autonomy and self-determination are gatekept by wealth and technical knowledge.** Whether it's control over what you reveal (privacy) or control over what you can become (AI augmentation) — the average person is locked out.

So I build tools that change that.

## Problems (P)

The fundamental issues I see in the world:

### P0: Privacy as Autonomy

The average person cannot control what they share about themselves. Privacy isn't about hiding — it's about the fundamental right to reveal exactly and only what you choose. This control is currently available only to those with technical knowledge or money.

### P1: AI Democratization

Human-AI convergence is happening, but access is stratified. AI should not be a tool only for elites. People everywhere should be able to augment and enhance themselves without being middle-class or above. The technology that could level playing fields is instead deepening divides.

### The Unified Problem

Both P0 and P1 are faces of the same issue: **autonomy over your own life is gatekept**. I'm working on both fronts.

## Missions (M)

My response to these problems:

### M1: Build Open Infrastructure for Personal Data Sovereignty

Building tools — all MIT licensed — that let people:
- Own their data
- Own their AI relationships
- Take their context with them
- Not depend on companies that will monetize them or institutions that can revoke access

The theme: **"The context you keep."**

### M2: Bridge Security and AI

Leveraging 20 years of Information Security expertise to ensure AI is deployed safely and accessibly. Bringing security-first thinking to a field that's moving faster than it understands.

## What I'm Building

**Sovereign Infrastructure**: Self-hosted, privacy-first, local-first systems that don't depend on cloud providers or platforms that can revoke access.

**AI Partnership Tools**: Memory systems, persona generators, and frameworks that let people own their relationship with AI — not rent it from a corporation.

**Privacy-First Applications**: Tools that let people share what they want, when they want, with whom they want — and nothing more.

Everything open source. Everything MIT licensed. Because this shouldn't be just for elites.

## The Philosophy

> "This isn't about building another platform that owns your data. It's about building tools that free you to move fast, stay light, and own your momentum."

**Rapid Development. High-Signal Feedback Loops. Sovereign Infrastructure.**

Build. Break. Learn. Push. Repeat.

*TELOS is a living framework. It evolves as I learn. The north star stays fixed: build tools that give people sovereignty over their own lives.*
