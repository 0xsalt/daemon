[ABOUT]

I'm a 20-year Information Security veteran who pivoted hard into AI in 2025. I build open-source tools that let people own their data, their AI relationships, and their digital sovereignty.

My focus: **"The context you keep."** Building infrastructure that can't be taken away — self-hosted, privacy-first, MIT licensed.

I believe autonomy and self-determination are gatekept by wealth and technical knowledge. I'm building tools to change that.

Pacific Time Zone

[MISSION]

Build open infrastructure for personal data sovereignty. Help people own their data, own their AI relationships, and take their context with them — not depend on companies that will monetize them or institutions that can revoke access.

Bridge 20 years of security expertise with AI to ensure this technology is deployed safely and accessibly. Security-first thinking for a field moving faster than it understands.

[TELOS]

TELOS is my framework for tracking purpose and direction. It connects problems I see in the world to missions addressing them, goals to achieve, and projects making it real.

Problems (P) - Issues I'm working to solve:
- P0: Privacy as autonomy — people can't control what they share about themselves
- P1: AI democratization — AI augmentation is stratified by wealth and access
- P-Unified: Both are faces of the same issue — autonomy over your own life is gatekept

Missions (M) - What I'm doing about it:
- M1: Build open infrastructure for personal data sovereignty — MIT licensed tools that let people own their context
- M2: Bridge security and AI — bringing security-first thinking to a field driving a Ferrari in its infancy

Theme: "The context you keep."

[WHAT_IM_BUILDING]

- Sovereign Infrastructure: Self-hosted, privacy-first systems that don't depend on cloud providers
- AI Partnership Tools: Memory systems and frameworks that let people own their AI relationships
- Privacy-First Applications: Tools for controlled sharing without surveillance

Everything open source. Everything MIT licensed.

[DAILY_ROUTINE]

Deep work blocks. Short feedback loops. Automation where it matters. Pragmatism over perfection.

[PREDICTIONS]

(To be added — currently observing, not predicting)

[PHILOSOPHY]

"This isn't about building another platform that owns your data. It's about building tools that free you to move fast, stay light, and own your momentum."

Rapid Development. High-Signal Feedback Loops. Sovereign Infrastructure.
